# Neuroscience Research in Collaboration with Fortin Lab

### Purpose

The goal of this research is to determine if we can predict what odor the rat is 
thinking of by decoding hippocampal neurons. 

### Tools and Installation

### Methods

__Peri-stimulus time histograms__ (PSTHs) were used to visual individual neurons 
firing count over the average time of all trials. A trial represents each time 
the rat held its nose in the odor port and averaged around 1000-1500 ms. Five 
PSTHs were created for each neuron separated by odor. The visuals were then used 
to find firing patterns in each neuron. 

__Multinomial logistic regression__ .

__Principal Component Analysis__ .
